# HyperMI:  A Privilege-level Secure Execution Environment #

## Introduction ##
  ***HyperMI*** is a **secure** and **in-kernel isolated** execution environment to protect Virtual Machines (VMs) against the compromised hypervisor. Currently, we designed and implemented ***HyperMI*** on the KVM-based cloud computing environment.     
***HyperMI*** consists of three parts: the HyperMI world, a modified host OS kernel (not trusted) and the Swith Gate.
